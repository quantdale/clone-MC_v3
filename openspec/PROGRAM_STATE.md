## What 117 implemented

Change 117 adds the player experience track: an XP/level model with the canonical
leveling curve, free-floating XP orbs that are attracted to and collected by the
player, and persistence of the accumulated level/XP. It is the model + orb runtime +
persistence — not the XP HUD (205), enchantment XP spending (118/119), or a full
XP-drop catalog (215).

- `src/player/ExperienceSystem.ts` (NEW) — `ExperienceSnapshot { version:1, level, xp }`,
  `computeXpToNext(level)` (`2L+7` / `5L-38` / `9L-158`, continuous at 16 and 31), and
  `ExperienceSystem` with `addXp` (level-only-rises, bad input no-op), `snapshot`,
  `restore` (rejects `version!=1`/non-int `level`/`xp<0`, clamps `xp` into `[0,xpToNext)`),
  and derived `progress`.
- `src/world/XpOrb.ts` (NEW) — `XP_ORB_TYPE_KEY='minecraft:xp_orb'`, the `XpOrb`
  interface, and strict `createXpOrb` (positive-integer `value`, non-negative `id`,
  finite coords/velocity, non-negative `ageTicks`).
- `src/simulation/XpOrbManager.ts` (NEW) — deterministic id minting, `spawnXpOrb`
  (jitter when an rng is supplied, else exact), `tickItemEntities(dt,px,py,pz,experience)`
  (age advance `round(dt*20)`; attraction within `orbAttractionRadius²` capped at the
  current distance — no overshoot; collect within `orbCollectRadius²` →
  `experience.addXp(value)`; despawn at `orbDespawnTicks`), `clear`/`getXpOrbs`, and
  037 `serializeAll`/`deserializeAll` (atomic on one bad record).
- `src/config/index.ts` (EDIT) — frozen `xp` block: attraction/collect radius,
  attraction speed, despawn ticks, spawn up-velocity, default orb value.
- `src/engine/Game.ts` (EDIT) — constructs `ExperienceSystem` + `XpOrbManager`, ticks
  orbs after item-entity collection, adds `experience` to `GameSaveSnapshot`, writes it
  in `savePlayerState`, restores it in `loadPlayerState`, and requires it in
  `isGameSaveSnapshot`.
- `src/player/PlayerInteraction.ts` (EDIT) — optional `xpOrbs?`/`xpOrbValue?`; on a
  productive break, spawns one orb of `xpOrbValue` at the block-center spawn.
- `src/storage/PlayerStateRecord.ts` (EDIT) — adds required `experience: unknown`;
  `validatePlayerStateRecord` rejects a missing `experience`.
- `src/storage/LegacyLocalStorageMigrator.ts` (EDIT) — seeds `experience` in
  `toPlayerStateRecord`.

## Validation evidence (117)

- typecheck: PASS (`tsc --noEmit`)
- lint: PASS (`eslint .`)
- unit: PASS 1418/1418 (prior 1391 + 27 new: ExperienceSystem 8, XpOrbManager 12,
  PlayerStateRecord 3, PlayerInteraction +2 productive-break)
- production build: PASS (`tsc --noEmit && vite build`)
- E2E: PASS 21/21 (rule/entity change; survival/drop tests stay green)

## Advancement decision

Change 117 is **VERIFIED** at 6/6 task groups (100%). All gates are green: typecheck,
lint, the 1418-unit suite, production build, and the required E2E suite (21/21). No
advancement exception was needed. Advance to 118.

## What 116 implemented

Change 116 integrates worn armor (points + toughness) into the damage calculation
as a reusable, testable rule, and wears armor durability when it absorbs a hit. It
is the calculation plus its data model — not the armor catalog (that is 215) or
enchantment protection (119).

- `src/inventory/ItemRegistry.ts` (EDIT) — `defensePoints?: number` and
  `toughness?: number` on `ItemTypeDefinition` (default `0`).
- `src/player/ArmorProtection.ts` (NEW) — pure functions on worn stacks + a bound class:
  - `computeArmorStats(stacks, registry)` → `{ points, toughness }`, summing
    `defensePoints`/`toughness` (missing def ⇒ 0) and clamping each to `[0, 20]`.
  - `reduceDamage(raw, stats, bypass)` → `{ reduced, absorbed }`; non-positive or
    bypass returns input unchanged; otherwise `armor=min(20,points)`, `cap=armor/25`,
    `tf=min(20,toughness)`, `retained=max(0,1 - sqrt(raw)/(sqrt(raw)+4+tf*2))`,
    `absorbed=raw*cap*retained`, `reduced=raw-absorbed`. ~80% cap at low damage;
    toughness preserves protection at high damage; zero armor ⇒ no reduction.
  - `applyArmorWear(stacks, absorbed, registry)` → `(ItemStack|null)[]`; each durable
    piece loses `max(1, ceil(absorbed/pieceCount))` via `DurabilityRules.applyDamage`;
    non-durable skipped; broken piece ⇒ `null`.
  - `ArmorProtection` class bound to `PlayerEquipment` + `ItemTypeRegistry`:
    `getStats()`, `reduce(raw, bypass)`, `applyWear(absorbed)` (mutates slots, clears
    broken pieces).
- `src/player/SurvivalSystem.ts` (EDIT) — stores the `DamageTypeRegistry`; optional
  `armor?` field; `isBypass(reason)` (unrecognized reason ⇒ non-bypass, fail-safe);
  `damage()` consults `armor` for non-bypass reasons, applies `ceil(reduced)` health
  loss, and calls `armor.applyWear(absorbed)` when `absorbed > 0`.
- `src/data/DamageType.ts` (EDIT) — `fall`, `drowning`, `lava`, `starvation` default
  definitions gain `BYPASS_ARMOR` (environmental damage ignores armor, parity).

## Validation evidence (116)

- typecheck: PASS (`tsc --noEmit`)
- lint: PASS (`eslint .`)
- unit: PASS 1391/1391 (prior 1374 + 14 new ArmorProtection + 3 SurvivalSystem integration; DamageType flag assertions updated)
- production build: PASS (`tsc --noEmit && vite build`)
- E2E: PASS 21/21 (no new e2e needed — rule-only change; survival/damage tests stay green)

## Advancement decision

Change 116 is **VERIFIED** at 6/6 (100%). All gates are green: typecheck, lint,
the new 1391-unit suite, production build, and the required E2E suite (21/21).
No advancement exception was needed. Advance to 117.

## What 115 implemented

Change 115 adds a general, pure, component-driven durability rule set and makes
`Inventory` delegate its wear/repair to it. It is reusable by later enchantment
(119) and anvil/grindstone/mending (948/949/2202/2203) changes.

- `src/inventory/DurabilityRules.ts` (NEW) — pure functions on an explicit
  `maxDurability` plus the stack's `DAMAGE_COMPONENT`:
  - `getRemainingDurability(maxDurability, stack)` → `max(0,min(max,max-damage))`
    for a tool, `0` for non-tool/empty/missing.
  - `isBroken(maxDurability, stack)` → true for a depleted tool (`remaining<=0`)
    or `count<=0`, false for non-tools.
  - `applyDamage(maxDurability, stack, amount)` → `{ stack, broke }`; accumulates
    `max(1,trunc(amount))` into `DAMAGE_COMPONENT`; on depletion returns
    `{ ...stack, count:0, components:undefined }` with `broke:true` (identical to
    the prior inline zeroing); non-tools/empty returned unchanged.
  - `repair(maxDurability, stack, amount)` → reduces `damage` by
    `max(1,trunc(amount))`, clamped at `0` (pristine, component removed);
    preserves `count`/identity; non-tool/empty/pristine returned unchanged.
- `src/inventory/Inventory.ts` (EDIT) — `damageSelectedItem` now delegates to
  `applyDamage` with identical observable behavior; new `repairSelectedItem`
  looks up `maxDurability` from the registry and delegates to `repair`, returning
  whether the selected tool changed.

## Validation evidence (115)

- typecheck: PASS (`tsc --noEmit`)
- lint: PASS (`eslint .`)
- unit: PASS 1374/1374 (prior 1354 + 18 new DurabilityRules + 2 new Inventory repair)
- production build: PASS (`tsc --noEmit && vite build`)
- E2E: PASS 21/21 (no new e2e needed — rule-only change; durability drop tests stay green)

## Advancement decision

Change 115 is **VERIFIED** at 5/5 (100%). All gates are green: typecheck, lint,
the new 1374-unit suite, production build, and the required E2E suite (21/21).
No advancement exception was needed. Advance to 116.

## What 114 implemented

Change 114 adds tool-tier and harvest rules driven by block/item tags. It
introduces a `miningLevel` (block) + `toolTier` (item) data model, mineable/tools
tag factories, and a `HarvestRules` module that decides effective tool, drop
eligibility, and break speed — wired into `PlayerInteraction`/`Game` so blocks
that require a tool no longer drop by hand.

- `src/world/BlockRegistry.ts` (EDIT) — `miningLevel?: number` on
  `BlockTypeDefinition`; set `miningLevel: 1` on the six pickaxe-family blocks
  (Stone, CoalOre, IronOre, Cobblestone, Bricks, Furnace). New `MINABLE_TAG_BY_KIND`
  + `createDefaultBlockTags(blockRegistry)` builds/finalizes
  `minecraft:mineable/{pickaxe,axe,shovel}` from `preferredTool`.
- `src/inventory/ItemRegistry.ts` (EDIT) — `toolTier?: number` on
  `ItemTypeDefinition`; `toolTier: 1` on WoodenPickaxe/WoodenAxe, `2` on
  StonePickaxe. New `TOOLS_TAG_BY_KIND` + `createDefaultItemTags(itemRegistry)`.
- `src/world/HarvestRules.ts` (NEW) — `HarvestRules` with `blockToolKind`,
  `toolKind`, `isEffectiveTool`, `canHarvest`, `getBreakDuration` (floor
  `MIN_BREAK_DURATION = 0.08`). Tag-driven kind; tier gate: effective iff kind
  matches AND (`miningLevel===0` OR `toolTier>=miningLevel`); harvestable iff level
  0, or right kind + `toolTier>=miningLevel`.
- `src/player/PlayerInteraction.ts` (EDIT) — optional `harvestRules?` field;
  `getBreakDuration` delegates to `HarvestRules` with legacy fallback; `finishBreak`
  gates drops on `canHarvest` (no drop when not harvestable; block still removed,
  tool still damaged).
- `src/engine/Game.ts` (EDIT) — builds `blockTags`/`itemTags`/`harvestRules` after
  loot tables and injects `harvestRules` into `PlayerInteraction`.

## Validation evidence (114)

- typecheck: PASS (`tsc --noEmit`)
- lint: PASS (`eslint .`)
- unit: PASS 1354/1354 (prior 1329 + 24 new HarvestRules + 1 PlayerInteraction)
- production build: PASS (`tsc --noEmit && vite build`)
- E2E: PASS 21/21 (drop tests target level-0 terrain; gating leaves them dropping)

## Advancement decision

Change 114 is **VERIFIED** at 7/7 (100%). All gates are green: typecheck, lint,
the new 1354-unit suite, production build, and the required E2E suite (21/21). No
advancement exception was needed. Advance to 115.

## What 113 implemented

Change 113 adds durable, serializable player-equipment state integrated with the
existing `Inventory`. It is state + integration only: no protection math, shield
logic, or HUD.

- `src/inventory/Equipment.ts` (NEW) — `EquipmentSlot` (Head/Chest/Legs/Feet/Offhand),
  `EQUIPMENT_SLOT_ORDER`, `ARMOR_SLOTS`, `EquipmentSnapshot { version:1, slots:(ItemStack|null)[] }`,
  and `PlayerEquipment`:
  - `getEquipment(slot)` → `ItemStack | null`;
  - `setEquipment(slot, stack|null)` stores/replaces and returns the previous stack,
    clamping `count` into `[1, MAX_STACK]`, preserving `components`;
  - `clear()` empties all five slots;
  - `getArmorStacks()` returns non-null armor in Head→Chest→Legs→Feet order (the
    116 input);
  - `serialize()` (pure) + `restore(data, isValidItem)` / `validateSnapshot`
    (atomic — a malformed payload returns false without mutating any slot).
- `src/inventory/Inventory.ts` (EDIT) — `readonly equipment: PlayerEquipment`
  (ctor-initialized); `InventorySnapshot.equipment` (optional, backward compatible);
  `snapshot()` includes `equipment.serialize()`; `restore()` validates and restores
  equipment in its atomic early-return block, so a malformed equipment block rejects
  the whole restore.

## Validation evidence (113)

- typecheck: PASS (`tsc --noEmit`)
- lint: PASS (`eslint .`)
- unit: PASS 1329/1329 (prior 1306 + 23 new Equipment)
- production build: PASS (`tsc --noEmit && vite build`)
- E2E: PASS 21/21 (no new e2e needed — state-only change; 111/112 drop tests stay green)

## Advancement decision

Change 113 is **VERIFIED** at 6/6 (100%). All gates are green: typecheck, lint, the
new 1329-unit suite, production build, and the required E2E suite (21/21). No
advancement exception was needed. Advance to 114.

## What 112 implemented

Change 112 makes mined-block item entities collectible and self-managing: pickup
delay, merge policy, inventory insertion, and a despawn timer, wired into the
per-tick simulation.

- `src/world/ItemEntity.ts` — `ItemEntity.count` is now mutable; the manager is
  the sole owner of quantity (merge + partial pickup adjust it; `createItemEntity`
  still validates the initial value). Value domain unchanged (`1..stackSize`).
- `src/simulation/ItemEntityManager.ts` — constants `PICKUP_DELAY_TICKS = 10`
  (0.5s), `DESPAWN_AGE_TICKS = 6000` (5 min), `MERGE_RADIUS = 0.25`,
  `PICKUP_RADIUS = 1.5`, and three methods:
  - `mergeEntities(radius)` — folds overlapping same-item entities into one up to
    `stackSize`; iterates a stable id snapshot so 3+ overlaps fold idempotently
    into a single entity; returns removed count.
  - `despawnExpired(maxAgeTicks)` — removes entities with `ageTicks >= cap`
    (inclusive); returns removed count.
  - `collectPlayerDrops(px,py,pz, insert, pickupRadius)` — for each deliverable
    drop (past delay AND within radius), offers `insert(item,count)` (mirrors
    `Inventory.addItem`'s leftover contract); removes on full insert, reduces
    `count` on partial; returns total collected; iterates a snapshot.
- `src/engine/Game.ts` — in the active-simulation block after
  `tickItemEntities(dt)`, runs `mergeEntities()`, `despawnExpired()`, and
  `collectPlayerDrops(player.position…, (id,n)=>inventory.addItem(id,n))`, and
  re-renders the hotbar when collection returns > 0.

## Validation evidence (112)

- typecheck: PASS (`tsc --noEmit`)
- lint: PASS (`eslint .`)
- unit: PASS 1306/1306 (prior 1290 + 16 new ItemPickup)
- production build: PASS (`tsc --noEmit && vite build`)
- E2E: PASS 21/21 (new `breaking a block drops an item the player collects`; 111
  `breaking a block spawns a world item entity` regression stays green)

## Advancement decision

Change 112 is **VERIFIED** at 6/6 (100%). All gates are green: typecheck, lint,
the new 1306-unit suite, production build, and the required E2E suite (21/21,
including the new collect test and the preserved 111 spawn test). No advancement
exception was needed. Advance to 113.

## What 111 implemented

Change 111 adds world item-entity spawning for block/entity drops.

- `src/world/ItemEntity.ts` (NEW) — `ITEM_ENTITY_TYPE_KEY 'minecraft:item'`; `ItemEntity`
  interface (id, item, count, x/y/z, vx/vy/vz, ageTicks); `createSpawnPosition(bx,by,bz)`
  → block center `{x+0.5,y+0.5,z+0.5}`; strict `createItemEntity` validating finite
  coords/velocity and a non-negative integer `ageTicks`.
- `src/simulation/ItemEntityManager.ts` (NEW) — per-world store; strict id minting;
  `spawnItemEntity` (item-registry + positive-integer-count + stackSize + finite-coord
  validation, atomic on rejection); `spawnLootStacks` (splits each stack into
  `ceil(count/stackSize)` entities with deterministic rng jitter, or exact positions with
  no rng); `removeItemEntity` / `getItemEntity` / `getItemEntities` (insertion order) /
  `getItemEntitiesInChunk` (floor x/16, floor z/16); `tickItemEntities(dt)` ages by
  `round(dt*20)`, no-op when `dt<=0`; `clear` / `size`; `serializeAll` / `deserializeAll`
  to the 037 `SerializedEntity` envelope (atomic all-or-nothing validation, resets nextId
  to maxId+1). Velocity stored for 130 physics.
- `src/player/PlayerInteraction.ts` — `itemEntities?` constructor field; `finishBreak`
  collects drops into `LootStack[]` (loot table, else `dropItem`/`resourceId` fallback;
  leaves → `ItemId.Apple`) and routes them through `itemEntities.spawnLootStacks` at the
  block center. The `selector.addItem` drop path is removed; `onAction('break', primaryDropId)`
  is unchanged.
- `src/engine/Game.ts` — constructs `new ItemEntityManager({ itemRegistry, rng: Math.random })`,
  passes it to `PlayerInteraction`, ticks it each simulation step, and exposes it publicly
  (`window.__voxelGame.itemEntities`).

## Validation evidence (111)

- typecheck: PASS (`tsc --noEmit`)
- lint: PASS (`eslint .`)
- unit: PASS 1290/1290 (prior 1267 + 23 new ItemEntityManager + rewritten PlayerInteraction ore test)
- production build: PASS (`tsc --noEmit && vite build`)
- E2E: PASS 20/20 (new `breaking a block spawns a world item entity`)

## Advancement decision

Change 111 is **VERIFIED** at 6/6 (100%). All gates are green: typecheck, lint, the new
1290-unit suite, production build, and the required E2E suite (20/20). No advancement
exception was needed. Advance to 112.

## Next change: 118 (pending artifacts)

`118-enchantment-registry` is named in `CHANGE_SEQUENCE.md` with scope "Enchantment
definitions, levels, applicability, conflict rules." Per `AGENTS.md`, a change lacking
full artifacts is a hard pre-implementation block. Author and validate those artifacts
via `SPEC_AUTHORING_PROTOCOL.md` before any production code.

## Resume rule

A future session must first inspect current `origin/main`, this state, and the 117
verification. Change 118 is the next change; its artifacts must be authored and
validated before implementation begins.
