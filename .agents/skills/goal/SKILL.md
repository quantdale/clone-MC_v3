Use `$ARGUMENTS` as goal-mode arguments. Read applicable `AGENTS.md`, `.agent/PLANNER_HANDOFF.md`, `.agent/EXECUTION_PROMPT.md` if present, and native goal/campaign/state/OpenSpec files. Inspect current Git and implementation. If the planner prompt is `ACTIVE`, reconcile work since `Planned-From`, resume the first genuinely incomplete requirement, execute autonomously, preserve intended behavior, avoid unrelated rewrites, run required tests/integration validation, repair introduced Critical/High regressions, update durable state, and commit/push per repository policy. Mark `COMPLETED` only when acceptance criteria pass; `BLOCKED` only for a genuine blocker. Otherwise fall back to native continuation semantics; if none exists, report that a planner pass is required.
